"""Defense-in-depth user-prompt construction for MAGI orchestrator.

Sanitizes consumer-supplied content before embedding it in the LLM
user prompt. Four ordered layers: newline normalization, invisible
stripping, header neutralization, nonce-wrapped delimiters with a
fail-closed collision check.

Threat model and rationale: ``docs/python-prompt-hardening-port.md`` and
``docs/sbtdd/sanitize-spec-behavior.md``. The layer order is
load-bearing; see spec section 3.5 for the bypass analysis.

    The only current trigger is a nonce collision in
    :func:`build_user_prompt` (probability ~2^-128 per call with the
    default ``secrets`` RNG). The error message deliberately omits the
    nonce value: disclosing it would hand the attacker the very token
    they need to spoof the delimiters.

    Structural guard (2.4.1): this class is intentionally a sibling of
    ``ValidationError``, NOT a subclass. This DEVIATES from the
    project-wide convention in ``CLAUDE.local.md`` §0.1 (which says
    "Use ``ValidationError`` as the project-wide error type").

    Why the derogation: ``InvalidInputError`` is the only fail-closed
    security-critical exception in MAGI. The orchestrator retry handler
    at ``run_magi.py:531`` catches
    ``(ValidationError, json.JSONDecodeError)``. If ``InvalidInputError``
    inherited from ``ValidationError``, that catch would silently consume
    a fail-closed nonce-collision event and convert it into a single
    retry — defeating the purpose of fail-closed entirely.

    Future similar errors (other fail-closed security boundaries) should
    follow this pattern: sibling of ``ValidationError``, not subclass.
    The derogation is structural rather than conventional so it survives
    refactors that do not read this docstring. Per the locked decision on
    the v2.4.1 branch (2026-05-16, option B from the B-vs-F analysis).

    See ``tests/test_sanitize.py`` BDD-29 and BDD-35 for the pinned
    regression contract.

    Scope of the structural guard: the sibling relationship protects
    against any ``except ValidationError`` catch site, present or
    future. It does **NOT** protect against bare ``except Exception``,
    ``except BaseException``, ``asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)``
    (which captures exceptions into a list), or ``ExceptionGroup`` /
    ``except*`` flattening. Those broader catches are residual latent
    bypass shapes; they are out of scope for this guard because
    closing them structurally would conflict with legitimate uses of
    those constructs elsewhere in the codebase.
