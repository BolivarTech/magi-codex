"""Process-liveness locking for MAGI run directories.

Each run directory under the per-project temp namespace carries a
``.magi-lock`` file naming the PID and ISO start timestamp of the
orchestrator that owns it. ``temp_dirs.cleanup_old_runs`` consults
:func:`is_dir_live` so a concurrent MAGI session never prunes a run
directory whose owning process is still alive.

The lock is advisory and self-healing: a crashed process leaves a stale
lock behind, but :func:`is_pid_alive` reports the dead PID as not alive
on the next cleanup, and :data:`LOCK_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` bounds the
window in which a reused PID could keep a dead run's directory alive.
Corrupt or empty locks (unparseable PID, garbage or future-dated timestamp)
are bounded by the dir-mtime escape: the dir is retained while fresh and
reclaimed once it ages past :data:`LOCK_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`.  Residual: a
corrupt lock carrying a *valid recent timestamp and an implausibly large bound*
is over-retained up to that bound rather than the floor (bounded over-retention,
not a crash or an unbounded leak).
