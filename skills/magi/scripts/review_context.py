    """Internal enrichment logic; may raise (caller wraps in try/except).

    Args:
        input_content: The original review content to potentially enrich.
        repo_root: Optional path to the git repository root.
        base_ref: The base git ref to diff against.
        max_chars: Maximum characters for the enriched output.
        diff: Pre-resolved review diff (A2 single source) or ``None`` to resolve
            internally. ``None`` is the sentinel for "not provided"; any ``str``
            (including ``""``) is consumed verbatim without calling
