"""Parse and validate agent JSON output from model CLI backends.

Extracts structured JSON from Codex/Claude CLI output formats,
strips markdown code fences, recovers the JSON verdict even when an
agent wraps it in natural-language prose (2.4.2), validates the result,
and writes clean JSON to the specified output file.

Usage:
    python3 parse_agent_output.py <input_file> <output_file>

Exit codes:
    0 - Success: valid JSON extracted and written to output file.
    1 - Failure: input could not be parsed or did not contain valid JSON.

def _embedded_verdict_object(text: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Return the *sole* embedded JSON object that looks like an agent verdict.

    Scans for ``{`` and attempts ``json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode`` from each
    position — which parses one complete JSON value and reports where it
    ended, so nested braces and braces inside strings are handled without
    hand-rolled counting.

    Selection is **schema-aware, not span-based**: only objects carrying the
    verdict discriminator keys (:data:`_VERDICT_KEYS`) qualify, so a large
    JSON document an agent echoes from tool use — ``package.json``, an API
    payload — cannot be mistaken for the verdict even when it out-spans it.

    Recovery succeeds **only when exactly one** qualifying object decodes
    *within the probe budget* (:data:`_MAX_BRACE_PROBES`). If two or more do
    (the agent quoted the schema example — which is a complete valid verdict,
    see ``agents/*.md`` — beside its real verdict, or content under review
    embedded one), the choice is ambiguous: picking either risks a fabricated
    ``approve`` entering consensus, which ``load_agent_output`` cannot catch
    because both are well-formed. We return ``None`` so the caller fails
    closed and the orchestrator retries rather than guessing. (2.4.2 pass-2
    review — consensus integrity.) Note the budget bound: a second qualifying
    object beyond the probe cap would not be seen, so a verdict followed by
    >2000 brace positions then a second verdict is the one ambiguity shape the
    guard cannot observe — acceptable, as that input is already pathological.

    The scan is bounded by :data:`_MAX_BRACE_PROBES` so adversarial
    deeply-nested-unterminated input cannot degrade to O(n^2). A
    :class:`RecursionError` from a deeply nested candidate is treated like a
    decode failure (skip the candidate) rather than aborting the scan.

    Known residual (single-match fabrication): when exactly one verdict-shaped
    object decodes but it is NOT the real verdict — a quoted example beside a
    truncated real verdict, an early echo with the real verdict beyond the
    probe cap, or a lone echoed example — it is recovered and a fabricated
    ``approve`` can reach consensus. The durable fix is a verdict
    sentinel/delimiter (or Option C). See CLAUDE.md "Durable verdict-recovery
    fix". Do not add more heuristic tuning here; the next change should be the
    sentinel.

    Args:
        text: Text that may contain a verdict object embedded in prose.

        The single qualifying verdict ``dict``, or ``None`` if zero qualify,

    """Parse JSON from *text*, tolerating natural-language prose around it.

    The fast path is a strict :func:`json.loads`: in the common case the
    text *is* the JSON object (optionally after fence stripping) and the
    behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to before 2.4.2. When that raises —
    which happens when an agent doing multi-turn tool use prepends a
    transitional sentence before the JSON verdict (the 2.4.2 exit-1 root
    cause) — the embedded verdict object is recovered via
    :func:`_embedded_verdict_object`.

    Recovery is skipped for input larger than
    :data:`_LENIENT_RECOVERY_MAX_CHARS` (likely echoed tool-use content, and
    a scan hazard). If nothing qualifies, the original
    :class:`json.JSONDecodeError` is re-raised so output with no JSON object,
    a truncated verdict (whose stray complete sub-objects lack the verdict
    keys), an ambiguous multi-verdict output, or only echoed non-verdict
    objects still fails closed at this layer. The orchestrator relies on that
    exception to drive its single retry and degraded-mode handling; the full
    7-key schema is still enforced downstream by ``load_agent_output``.

    A :class:`RecursionError` (CPython's ``json`` raises it, not
    ``JSONDecodeError``, on deeply nested input) is mapped to a
    ``JSONDecodeError`` so deeply-nested echoed/adversarial output stays on
