    The denominator is ``num_agents`` (not ``len(majority_agents)``) by
    design: a minority that disagrees dilutes the numerator, so a
    unanimous win yields a higher confidence than a bare-majority one
    even when the surviving side's own confidence is identical. This
    is the "dissent dilution" term — operators reading a moderate
    confidence on a narrow win should treat it as "the split itself
    reduces certainty", not as "the majority is individually uncertain".
    ``weight_factor`` then independently scales by how far the score is
    from zero, so a unanimous approve (score=1) and unanimous reject
    (score=-1) both land at the same high confidence, while an exact
    tie (score=0) halves confidence regardless of individual votes.
